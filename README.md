# hex-color-generator
hex_colors

The code defines a JavaScript function called "changeColor" that generates a random hexadecimal color code by selecting random characters from the array "hex_numbers" (which contains digits 0-9 and letters A-F) six times. It then updates the HTML element with the id "hex-code" to display the generated hexadecimal code and changes the background color of the web page's body to the corresponding color represented by the generated code.
